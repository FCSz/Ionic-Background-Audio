This is a very simple Ionic app that tries to play an audio file in the background.It uses these plugins;* cordova-plugin-background-mode* @ionic-native/background-mode* cordova-plugin-nativeaudio* @ionic-native/native-audioWhen tested the audio did not continue playing when in the background. It did continue upon returning to the foreground.Configuration* Nexus 5X* Android 7.1.2* Build N2G48C
